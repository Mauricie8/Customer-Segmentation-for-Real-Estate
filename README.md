## Introduction
This project was developed as part of a trial for a recruitment process four years ago. It focused on analyzing customer data for a real estate development, which had 150 apartments. The primary objective was to classify different types of buyers, understand their interests and demographic data, and analyze customer satisfaction through survey results. Thanks to the insights generated from this analysis and the interactive Power BI report, I was selected from 115 candidates to advance to the next stage of the recruitment process.


## Problem Statement
The main objective in the report was to identify key buyer indicators, including demographic profiles, purchasing preferences, and satisfaction levels. The challenge was to gain meaningful insights from survey data, with the goal of classifying customers into different segments. Additionally, the company wanted to evaluate how satisfaction scores across various categories impacted through customer perceptions.
